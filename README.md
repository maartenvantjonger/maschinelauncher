# Configuration #

No configuration necessary since Machine Launcher will ask you for your Machine application path if it is not in the standard location.
Alternatively, this path can be configured in the MaschineLauncher.exe.config file in the ApplicationPath app setting.
In case Native Instruments releases a new Maschine controller, its device ID (see Windows Device Manager) can be added to the DeviceIDs app setting.
